## Joy independent of sensual and ego pleasures
* 3 pleasures
  1. pleasure of the senses (eat something tasty)
  2. pleasure of the ego (receive praise)
  3. pleasure/joy independent of the senses or ego
* train mind to access joy even when free of stimulation
  1. easing into joy - resting mind to put it at a state of ease -> joy becomes accessible
  2. inclining the mind towards joy - notice joy and give it full attention (joy that already existed)
  3. uplifting the mind - uplift with wholesome joy: goodness, generaosity, loving kindess, compassion
