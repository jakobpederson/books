# Joy on Demand
## By: Chade-Meng Tan

# Introduction
## How I learned to be Jolly for Fun and Profit
* happiness is a skill

## Happiness is Highly Trainable
* people generally return to a stable level of happiness even after major positive or negative life events
* possibly genetically influenced
* joy & calm are trainable skills
* training can positively influence your entire life
* exercise training for the mind: meditation (mind training)
  1. "a family of mental training practices that are designed to familiarize the practitioner with the types of mental processes"
* specifically: mindfulness meditation
* mindfulness: paying attention in a particular way - on purpose, in present moment, non-judgementally
* Sangy Khadro (Kathleen McDonald): "it is all about cultivating the mind"
* meditation leads to happiness

## Joy independent of sensual and ego pleasures
* 3 pleasures
  1. pleasure of the senses (eat something tasty)
  2. pleasure of the ego (receive praise)
  3. pleasure/joy independent of the senses or ego
* train mind to access joy even when free of stimulation
  1. easing into joy - resting mind to put it at a state of ease -> joy becomes accessible
  2. inclining the mind towards joy - notice joy and give it full attention (joy that already existed)
  3. uplifting the mind - uplift with wholesome joy: goodness, generaosity, loving kindess, compassion
* these techniques give us the strength to deal with difficulties and emotional pain

## Joy leads to success
* joy leads to happiness and happiness leads to success
* happiness is a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind

# Chapter 1: Joy Becomes You
* charisma, calm, compassion, creativity, and success are mutually reinforcing
* meditation can make you more confident
* 3 kinds of confidence
  1. confidence arising from knowing
  2. confidence arising from equanimity
  3. condience arising from resilience

## The Luck of the Happy
* being born in the right circumstances
* being in the right place in the right time
* being surrounded by good people

## Chapter 2: Just one breath? Surely you jest
* workarounds for training (which is hard)
  1. use a community
  2. incorporate training into daily life
  3. joy:
    * easing into it skillfully
    * making it fun
* "joy point" - when meditation practice becomes self-sustaining

## Don't worry be lazy
* "wise laziness" - too lazy to do unnecessary work

## How long before I get benefits?
* between 50 & 100 hours
* study shows 100 minutes
* takes a long time to master but short time to change life

## Just one breath? Surely you can't be serious
> Formal Practice:
> One Mindful breath
> for duration of one slow deep breath give full attention to your breath in a gentle way (bring attention to the feeling in nose or belly)
* being in the present temporarily free of regret and worry

## Gentle and intense
* 2 key ingredients for optimization
  1. gentleness in attitude
    * physical relaxation
    * mental ease
    * loving kindness
  2. intensity of attention
    * the more intense the more freedom
    * longer lasting benefits
* high intensity interval training (HIIT)
  1. 30 min of sustained training == 1 minute of going all out
  2. apply concept to meditation
* general rule: always choose gentleness over intensity

## Make breathing a habit
* habit is a loop consisting of 3 parts:
  1. cue - activates habit
  2. routine - behavior
  3. reward - perceived benefit
* cues for mindful breathing habit
  * first moment you wake up
  * moment you lie down at night
  * hourly chime to phone
  * everytime you have to wait (boredom becomes the cue)

## Joy starts here, with the first breath
* initially joy from any of 4 sources
  1. joy of novelty - experience something new (short lived)
  2. joy of perceived agency - can control what we thought we could not (short lived)
  3. joy of momentary relief from afflication - depression, despair, etc (sustainable)
  4. joy of ease - available when the mind is alert & relaxed (basic meditative state) (sustainable)
* the ability to reliably access a highly sustainable source of gentle joy with practice

## Stupidest advice Gopi has ever received from me
* one breath a day leads to an hour a day
* one breath increases your mind training

# Chapter 3: From on breath to one Googol
* fruits of meditation
  * free coins available to all
  * the more you get the better off you are

## The Basic Training: settling the mind
* simplest meditative skill - settle the mind
* resting the mind into some degree of stillness
* 3 methods:
* 1. anchoring - bringing gentle awareness to a chosen object (and returning awareness if it wanders) like breath, sensory experiences, etc.
* 2. resting - cease work or movement to relax
