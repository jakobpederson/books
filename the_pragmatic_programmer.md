## Take Responsibility
* responsibility is something you actively agree to
* you have the right not to take responsibility for an impossible situation
* make call based on ethics and judgement
* when you make a mistake admit it:
  1. honestly
  2. try to offer options
* do not:
  1. blame
  2. make excuses
* Run conversation through your head:
  1. what is the other person likely to say?
  2. will they ask "have you tried this?"
  3. how will your respond?
  4. before you go is there anything you can try?
* Do not say it cannot be done: explain what can be done to salvage the situation
* Do not be afraid to ask for help
> Provide Options do not Make Excuses

## Software Entropy
* "software rot"
> Don't live with broken windows
* "broken windows": bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code
* fix a "broken window" ASAP
* if you don't have time to fix a "broken window" then board it up
  1. take SOME action
  2. biggest source of rot: neglect

## Putting out Fires

  4. show people and let them marvel
  5. (pretend it's not important) "It would be better if we added X"
  6. make people request you add what you want to add
